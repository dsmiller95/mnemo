TODO:
 - Implement web interface for editing the data.
   - goto item by index number
   - goto page by name
   - goto previous page
   - goto next page
   - new page (auto-mkdir)
   - delete page (purge empty dirs?)
   - rename (move) page
 - Change passwords to salted hashes so they're not stored in the clear.
 - Add user profile editing pages.
   - Add password change page and link from login page.
   - Add page to edit user profile (timout, width, showEdit, (email?))
 - Add remote user admin pages.
   - Add email to user profile.
   - Implement a password-reset-code URL which can be e-mailed to the user.
   - Add request password reset page and link from login page.
   - Add a page to register as a new user, reset code mailed on approval.
     (Also add code to getNextDueItem to create a dummy page and item
      and jump directly to edit mode if there's no data dir for the user.)

WISH LIST:
 - Log session response summaries. (Rolling log?)
