TODO:
 - PORT TO PHP with MySQL.
 - Change passwords to salted hashes so they're not stored in the clear.
 - Add user profile editing page for
   - password
   - timout
   - width
   - showEdit
   - language
   - (email?)
 - Implement pick-group-from-list-of-links page for edit mode.
 - Implement group-file upload.
 - Implement "expert" raw-data edit mode for group files.
 - Implement multi-item edit form (groups of 10/25/50 items?).
 - Internationalize the user interface.
 - Add an interface to help users who can't log in.
   - Add email to user profile.
   - Implement a password-reset-code URL which can be e-mailed to the user.
   - Add request password reset page and link from login page.
   - Add a page to register as a new user, reset code mailed on approval.
     (Also add code to getNextDueItem to create a dummy group and item
      and jump directly to edit mode if there's no data dir for the user.)

MAYBE/WISH LIST:
 - Log session response summaries. (Rolling log?)
 - Add a "Search" interface (group names, item content).
 - Allow users to add multimedia objects (pic, sound, video) to items.
   (Look into those editor widgets used on various blogs.)
 - Add the ability to append small (less than 24k) binary images to question
   and answer as embedded base64 data.  This doesn't work in IE, but works
   in Firefox and Chrome.  Test it on other platforms (like the DSi's Opera).
   See the example "embedded_image.html" file in the sample_data dir.
